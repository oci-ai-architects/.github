Enterprise AI on OCI moves fast. The official docs tell you what's possible. This org tells you how to actually build it — production patterns, real implementations, tested skill packs.

Everything here is extracted from working systems, not demos.

## Projects

**[oci-ai-architect](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects/oci-ai-architect)** — Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Architect reference. OCI GenAI, Dedicated AI Clusters, Oracle ADK, enterprise AI patterns. The starting point for any serious OCI AI build.

**[claude-code-oci-ai-architect-skills](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects/claude-code-oci-ai-architect-skills)** — Claude Code skills for OCI AI Architects. Community-led reference implementations, architecture patterns, and OCI-specific workflows.

**[cline-oci-ai-architect-skills](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects/cline-oci-ai-architect-skills)** — Cross-platform skills for Cline, Cursor, RooCode, and Windsurf. Same OCI patterns, any coding agent.

**[oci-coe-starter-kit](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects/oci-coe-starter-kit)** — Production-ready skill packs for building an AI Center of Excellence on OCI. 4 packs: GenAI, ADB AI, Clinical AI, Coding Agents.

**[openclaw-on-oci](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects/openclaw-on-oci)** — One-click OCI deployment stack for OpenClaw with Podman-first runtime, Bastion access, and OCI GenAI integration.

**[oci-one-click-stacks](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects/oci-one-click-stacks)** — OCI Terraform/OpenTofu stack portfolio from simple to advanced. Reproducible infrastructure for AI workloads.

## Background

Built by enterprise AI architects who run production AI systems on Oracle Cloud. The patterns here are battle-tested — from AI Centers of Excellence to multi-cloud agent deployments.

Contributions welcome. If you're building AI systems on OCI, this is your community.
